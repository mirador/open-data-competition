					<h1>About</h1>
					<p><a href="http://fathom.info/mirador">Mirador</a> is a software tool to explore complex datasets and to help you find new correlations in the data. Mirador was created as a collaboration between <a href="http://fathom.info/">Fathom Information Design</a> and the <a href="http://sabetilab.org/">Sabeti Lab</a> at Harvard University and the Broad Institute. 

					<p>We believe that open acess to scientific, health, and goverment data (among many other areas) promotes public participation and transparency in research and governance. So, we put together the Mirador Open Data Competition to highlight the importance of Open Data and also to give you some rewards for your findings with Mirador!</p>

					<p>We packaged four publicly available datasets in health, sports and global development, and you will have one month to explore these datasets with Mirador and submit your findings. A jury of specialists will evaluate the submissions and make a selection of three winning entries based on novelty, significance, and potential impact.</p>

					<p>Keep reading on to learn about the details of the competition, and how to use Mirador to explore the datasets and submit your discoveries. Thank you for your interest, and good luck!</p>

					<h1>Getting started</h1>
					<p>The Mirador Open Data Competition will be open between <b>Sunday September 28th</b> and <b>Tuesday October 28th</b>. During that time, you will be able to upload your correlation discoveries from Mirador into your competition account. Follow the next steps to get started in the competition:

					<ol>

					<h1>Datasets</h1>
					<p>We choose four datasets in health, sports and global development that are, in our view, good representatives of Open Data initatives, by virtue of being all publicly available, well documented, and up-to-date. These datasets are also complex and rich in interesting and unexpected correlations between thousands of variables!</p>

					<h1>Jury</h1>
					<p>The jury for the Mirador Open Data Competition is formed by experts in the domain each dataset comes from, we will be posting their names here soon.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h1>Instructions</h1>
					<p>In order to succesfully participate in this competition, you first need to create an account, and then download the latest version of Mirador for Mac or Windows and any of the datasets listed above. You can sumbit any number of correlations from Mirador into your competition account, but by the end of the competition period you need to select up to 10 findings for evaluation by the jury. The following videos guide you through the process, from registering your competition account, downloading the datasets, using Mirador to explore the data, and finally submitting your findings:</p>

					<h1>Getting help</h1>					
					<p>Mirador is an ongoing open-source project, so if you find bugs or any other issues, please report them <a href="https://github.com/mirador/mirador/issues">here</a>, and we will try to fix them during the course of the competition. Issues concerning the account page should be reported <a href="https://github.com/mirador/open-data-competition/issues">here</a>.</p>
                    <p>For urgent questions about registering, using Mirador, or submitting results, you can also contact us <a href="
						mailto:andres@fathom.info?
						subject=Mirador:%20feedback&amp;

					<h1>Visualizing the competition!</h1>
					<p>Finally, there is a little art project taking place alongside the competition... Every time you submit a new finding with Mirador, the sequence of steps from the moment you launched Mirador until you upload the correlation (which variables are visible, changes in the covariate ranges, etc.) is also stored in your competition account. After the competition is finished, we would like to create a visualization of these sequences from all the participants, with the goal of creating a visual representation of the process of data exploration with Mirador.</p>
