					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>We live in challenging but also exciting times. We have computational tools that we can run even on our mobile devices - which are much more powerful than the supercomputers that filled entire rooms a few decades ago. Alongside with the exponential growth of computing memory and speed, our capacity to generate and store all kinds of data in digital format –biological, social, financial– has also increased at unprecedented rate. Thanks to the Internet, we have access to freely available computational tools, as well as to public datasets. The combination of these factors is making possible to people from all over the world to engage with the process of scientific research not only as mere passive spectators but also as active participants, by looking into complex data and asking and answering their own questions. The value of Open Data is thus extraordinary, both as the hallmark of research transparency and the enabler for participatory Citizen Science.</p>

					<p>This is why we decided to come up with the Mirador Open Data Competition! We have developed a new data exploration tool called Mirador and made freely available to everyone, and we have also curated a number of rich public datasets to visualize with Mirador.</p>
